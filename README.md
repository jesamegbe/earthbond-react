This is an exercise for a recruitment process for Earthbond. It requires designing and developing a landing page for their(Earthbond) website. 
I used figma to design the landing page, where I created a style guide around clean solar energy as it is a company that focuses on solar nstallation. So it was necessary to build a style guide around that.
I also used react.js, for developing the frontend as I am more comfortable using the a framework and not the traditional HTML, CSS and Javascript.
